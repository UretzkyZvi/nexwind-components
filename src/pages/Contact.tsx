                  Iâ€™m Greg Uretzky. I live in the Netherlands, where I craft the
                  web's future.

                  <p>
                    From a young age, technology captured my imagination. Today,
                    I blend creativity and coding to build digital experiences
                    that matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beyond code, I'm passionate about the great outdoors,
                    finding inspiration in nature's complexity and beauty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My journey in technology began with tinkering on my family's
                    old computer, leading to a deep dive into web development
                    during my teenage years. This exploration laid the
                    foundation for my career as a full-stack developer, where I
                    leverage languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python
                    to turn complex problems into elegant solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I thrive in environments that challenge the status quo,
                    constantly seeking to learn new frameworks and technologies.
                    My toolbox is ever-expanding, with recent endeavors into
                    cloud services and containerization to streamline
                    development and deployment processes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Collaboration and knowledge sharing form the cornerstone of
                    my professional ethos. I actively contribute to open-source
                    projects and enjoy mentoring aspiring developers, believing
                    that our collective growth strengthens the tech community.

                    When not glued to a computer screen, you can find me hiking
                    through the Netherlands' picturesque landscapes or planning
                    my next adventure. These moments away from the keyboard are
                    crucial, providing fresh perspectives that I bring back to
                    my work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Looking ahead, I am excited by the possibilities of emerging
                    technologies and their potential to solve real-world
                    problems. Whether it's through developing innovative web
                    applications or contributing to sustainability through tech,
                    I am committed to making an impact.
