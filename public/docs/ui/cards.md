# Card Component Suite Documentation

This documentation outlines a suite of Card components designed for React applications, facilitating the creation of various card layouts with ease. The suite includes a base `Card` component and specialized components for different card types, including those with headers, images, and buttons. These components provide a flexible foundation for building visually appealing card-based interfaces.

## Base Components

### Card

#### Props

- `children`: The content of the card.
- `className`: Optional custom styling for the card.

### Usage

```jsx
<Card className="custom-class">
  {/* Card content goes here */}
</Card>
```

### CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter

These components structure the card's content, defining areas for the header, body, and footer sections.

#### Props (for each)

- `children`: The content of the respective section.
- `className`: Optional custom styling.

### Usage

```jsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>Header Content</CardHeader>
