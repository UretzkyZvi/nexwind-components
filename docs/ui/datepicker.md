# DatePicker Component Usage Guide

The `DatePicker` component is a customizable, interactive calendar for selecting dates in React applications. It leverages `date-fns` for date operations and `lucide-react` for icons. Here's how you can integrate and use the `DatePicker` component in your project.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `react` and `react-dom`
- `date-fns`: For handling date operations.
- `lucide-react`: For icons used in the component.

Install these dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react react-dom date-fns lucide-react
```
Or:
```bash
yarn add react react-dom date-fns lucide-react
```

## Integration

1. **Component Setup**: Create a file named `DatePicker.jsx` in your project's components directory and add the `DatePicker` component code to it.

2. **Usage**: Import and use the `DatePicker` component in your React application. Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import DatePicker from './path/to/DatePicker';

function App() {
  const handleDateChange = (date) => {
    console.log(date); // handle the date change
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <DatePicker onChange={handleDateChange} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## File Structure Recommendation

For maintainability, consider splitting the component into smaller parts. Suggested structure:

- `src/`
  - `components/`
    - `DatePicker/`
      - `DatePicker.jsx`: Main component file.
      - `MonthPicker.jsx`: Component for month selection.
      - `YearPicker.jsx`: Component for year selection.
  - `utils/`
    - `dateUtils.js`: Utility functions for date operations.

This structure helps in managing different parts of the `DatePicker` component more efficiently, making it easier to maintain and update.

## Customization and Extension

Feel free to customize and extend the `DatePicker` component according to your project's needs. For example, you can modify the styling, add more features like time selection, or integrate it with a form library.
